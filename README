These are some of the spec files I use to create packages
to get Puppet 4 running on AIX.  For the packages which 
require compiling I use IBM's xlc compiler.  I built my own
version of ruby 2.0 a while back, but since then Perzl has
added Ruby to his library.  I would trust his work more than
mine.  I put these together because PuppetLabs All-In-One 
agent for AIX isn't out yet and I need to work on converting
manifests and upgrading things. Most of these I copied from
others initially so I make no claims at originality here.  
Hopefully this helps others looking to do the same things.

Always look here for AIX rpms first:

And check PuppetLabs for their agent release:

(They'll probably release it the day after I go to the 
trouble of posting all of this)  ;-)
